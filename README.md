# predicting-poverty-replication
The purpose of this repository is to replicate the Jean et. al. (2016) paper using only Python3 and PyTorch. These more up-to-date tools and instructions should help anyone trying to build off this work.

```
git clone https://github.com/jmather625/predicting-poverty-replication
